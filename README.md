## PSA (2025-06-01): Issues with Alexa

In the last weeks, a lot of users reported issues with Alexa.
It seems to be a bug in the Alexa eco-system, which we cannot fix on our site.

We are currently in contact with Amazon and try to find the reasons for this.

## About

This project simulates bridges to publish your entities from Home Assistant to any Matter-compatible controller like
Alexa, Apple Home or Google Home. Using Matter, those can be connected easily using local communication without the need
of port forwarding etc.
