| light         | OnOffLight, DimmableLight, ColorTemperatureLight, ExtendedColorLight | Depends on the supported features attribute of the device.                                                                                                                                                                                          |

If you still want to try Speaker Devices with your controller, you can activate it using the `Feature Flags` in your Bridge configuration. |
