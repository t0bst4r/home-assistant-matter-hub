# Supported Device Types

The following device types are currently supported. If you need other device types, feel free to create a feature
request. Please make sure, that such devices are already supported by the
[Matter Device Specification](https://handbook.buildwithmatter.com/howitworks/devicetypes/) and the controller
you are using.

You can check matter support for Alexa
[here](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/smarthome/matter-support.html#device-categories-and-clusters).

You can check matter support for Google Home

Feel free to open a PR to improve this.<br/>Water Leak Detectors are not supported by every controller.                                                                                                                                              |

In Matter, "Auto" mode means that a device will automatically choose between heat and cool based on the current local temperature. This is matching the "heat_cool" feature in Home Assistant, but not the "Auto" feature. There is no matching feature in matter. |
